Welcome! This will be the home for the matching algorithm for Axe Meets. 

This is all still very much under construction, but we hope to iterate and make this dynamic.

The corresponding Google input form is here, and only currently accessible to Berkeley Haas: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQZdng-QwabJ6kCUDEVOlbwqypIp_P2oObZwbG2QQO9zvXaA/viewform?usp=sf_link

Main logic code currently found in axe_meets.py

Please email bobni@berkeley.edu if you have any questions!
