# Axe-iting Meets!

## Welcome! This will be the home for the matching algorithm for Axe-iting Meets (name subject to change). 

This is all still very much under construction, but we hope to iterate and make this better and smarter.

The corresponding Google input form is here, and only currently accessible to Berkeley Haas: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQZdng-QwabJ6kCUDEVOlbwqypIp_P2oObZwbG2QQO9zvXaA/viewform?usp=sf_link

Main logic code currently found in axe_meets.py

Please email bobni at berkeley.edu if you have any questions or have any input!

## TODO: FAQs

Q. How does the matching system work?
A. We prioritize "two-way" matches, which are matches where individuals have expressed an interest in meeting each other.
When these are exhausted, we prioritize "one-way" matching, and then randomly assigned the rest.
All selected matches have a random element to it to preserve privacy. 

Q. What if I'm not matched with someone new?
A. Based on the current matching algorithm, this means you're very popular! Unfortunately, this means this week you'll be interacting with someone you already know. 

Q. How often does matching happen?
A. Currently thinking of running this automatically on a weekly basis

Q. Is the matching algorithm stable?
A. haha no. 
but it might be in the futre!
